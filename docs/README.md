# File Notes

## .gitmessage

This is my personal Git Commit message template. This template is used by Git to populate a commit and provides hints
on using Conventional Commits properly.

To use it:

`git config --add commit.template path/to/.gitmessage` where `path/to` MAY be your user home directory, or other
location that you store curated development files.

## commit-format.md

This is a cheat sheet in Markdown. Print and hang in view of your workstation. Share. Laminate.
